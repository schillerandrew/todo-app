> ## Problem Domain

Refactor the To Do application (phase 3):

- Implement login, logout, role-based access and conditional rendering based on access:
  - Users with `read` access can view the to-do list and summary/count
  - Users with `update` access can also mark items as complete or incomplete
  - Users with `create` access can also add new items to the list 
  - Users with `delete` access can also remote items from the list
