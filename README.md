> ## Problem Domain

To Do application (phase 4) -- Integrating with a live API:

- Connect to different endpoints for:
  - creating an account (`/signup`)
  - logging in with basic authorization (`/signin`),
  - CRUD requests (`/todo`)

Access is still role-based, with:

- users can view and add items
- editors also can update item details
- admins also can delete items from to-do list
